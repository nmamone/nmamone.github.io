										<p>Hey! My names Nicholas, but most people call me Nick! I am a student studying at RMIT through OUA. Although this is a entry level subject, I am actually at the end of my study journey, I somehow missed completing this subject when I transferred to OUA.</p>

									<p>I am second generation Australian, but my grandparents came to Australia on boat from Italy. In saying that, don't expect me to speak Italian to you! <br> Over the past 6 years I have been studying part time whilst I grow and run my business, a media production company based in Sydney. </p>
								</div>
								<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
									<p>My company specialises in photography and covers events of all different shapes and sizes. From Clubs to Weddings to 70k+ festivals in Australia. The above image is one I took over the weekend at a 20k+ show in Sydney Showgrounds<br> When I'm not working or studying, you can find me on holidays soaking up the European sun.</p>

											<p>My interest in IT started when I was in year 9 at school. I was facinated by how websites were created and work.
											I started my own mini 'server' from my laptop and experimented with HTML and CSS (kind of like this assignment) and watched tones of YouTube videos on how to get it all working.
											I created a free domain name and pointed it to my home network and from there was even more intrigued on the networking side of things.</p>
										</header>
									</div>
									<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
										<p>I choose to study at RMIT for its flexibility. I was originally at an on campus university which required me to attend in person, which did not always work with my business.<br>
											RMIT offers a more flexible study plan than an on campus uni, and also allows me to go at my own pace.
										 </p>
									</div>
									<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
										<p>I expect to broaden my knowledge about IT during my studies, and explore different IT avenues that would otherwise be more difficult on my own.
											For example, iOS App Development is something that I tried (and failed) to learn over YouTube, but after completing the iOS App Dev unit, with my group we were able to design and deploy a fully featured app with API calls in 12 weeks! </p>

									The ideal job in IT for me would be an IT Property Operations Manager for The Star. Working in a precint is exciting for me as I would be
									able to see and interact with different aspects of the business, eg. Food & Beverage, Entertainment, Gaming etc., and no two days of work would be the same. <br>
								A link to a job posting can be found <a href="https://careers.star.com.au/en/job/525666/it-property-operations-manager" target="_blank">here</a>. If that link is unavailable you can find a screenshot of the job posting <a href="images/job.png" target="_blank">here</a>. The job is in Gold Coast which would require me to move intersate, something I have wanted to do for a while now. </p>
								</header>
							</div>
							<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
								<p>The position at The Star will require me to me to find and implement new IT initiatives and continually service and maintain existing IT infrastructure within the property. The role would require me to lead a team of people in IT operations and planning for future upgrades and improvements within the property. </p>
								<p>This role requires experience working in IT with a large organisation and strong Software Development Lifecycle understanding.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">

									<p>I currently have experience with developing and successfully deploying numerous websites, iOS App Development, Strong Communication, Leadership, Quick Learner and I am a Problem Solver.</p>
									<p>As I do not currently have any experience within large IT organisations, I would apply for a graduate position at The Star (which runs twice a year) and gain my experience through that. Throughout my time as a graduate, I will show initiative and show my interests about the Property Operations Manager role to my leaders.</p>
