							<h2>Project Idea</h2>
							<p>Garage Door Automation</p>
						</header>

						<!-- Content -->
							<section id="content">
								<h3>Overview </h3>
								<p>The project is an automated garage door opener that automatically opens and closes a garage door and / or gate based on a number of sensors. The system uses a base hub connected with wires directly to the garage and / or gate, a mobile phone is used to get GPS coordinates, a contact sensor on the doors to tell the system the current state of the door (whether they are open or closed), and a security camera to verify movements (whether a person or vehicle is entering or exiting a garage).</p>

																<h3>Motivation</h3>
																<p>The motivation behind this project is strongly influenced by my impatience. The last thing I want to be doing after a long drive home is sitting in my driveway, waiting for the garage to open, only to be pressing the remote vigorously to get a signal to tell the receiver to open. Not to tell you the number of times I have also left home not remembering if I have closed the garage door. With over 10 million homes in Australia, I’m sure I’m not the only one facing these problems. Using a Raspberry Pi and a few sensors, this solves both of those problems. </p>


																								<h3>Description</h3>
																								<p>The user will setup a Raspberry Pi hub in their home and connect the relevant wires from the hub to their garage door and / or gate trigger(s). They will also need to connect either through wires or wirelessly a contact sensor on both the garage door and gate so that they Raspberry Pi hub knows the current state of the door (open or closed). The Raspberry Pi can be connected to the internet either via Ethernet or Wi-Fi. A security camera will also need to be installed with a clear view of the garage door, and can be either connected directly to the Raspberry Pi or interfaced through NDI. The security camera is used in conjunction with AI to see if a person or car is entering or leaving the space (walking / driving towards or away from the camera = arriving / leaving respectively). The user will also need to download an app and will need to complete a one time setup to get the system online and automations happening.  </p>

																								<p>Once the user has the physical hardware setup, they are then able to complete the rest of the setup through their mobile phone. In the app, they will need to configure the device and tell the app which opener is connected to which port (eg. Garage is connected to trigger 1, Gate is connected to trigger 2, Garage is connected to Contact Sensor 1 etc.) and connect the security camera to the Raspberry Pi. The user will then enter their home address in the app and need to grant the app GPS Location Services. </p>

																								<p>Once all the hardware and the app is setup, when a user enters a garage space and the camera detects motion, the garage door and gate automatically open. The user will then get in their car, and drive off. The camera will again see the car leaving the driveway, and when the car has cleared the garage, the system will automatically close the garage door. When the user then leaves the street, the GPS will report back to the Pi base and the gate will then automatically close. </p>

																								<p>The reverse will happen when the user then arrives home. The GPS from the phone will ping the Pi hub when the user turns into the street, triggering the gate to open. When the GPS is within 10m of coordinates of the front driveway, the garage door will then start to open. Once the car has parked inside the garage and the security camera detects that the driver has left the vehicle, it will then close the garage door and gate simultaneously. </p>

																								<p>The app is smart enough to detect when multiple users have the same app installed on their phone and are travelling together (eg. Mum and Dad both have the app on their phone and leave or arrive home at the same time – without proper integration it would cause the roller doors to be triggered twice, which is why we have the contact sensors telling us when the door is in a fixed or travelling state). </p>

																								<h3>Tools and Technologies </h3>
																								<p>The project uses a number of different tools and technologies to get up and running:</p>

								<ul>
									<li>Raspberry Pi with 2GB Micro SD Card running the latest Pi OS</li>
									<li>Open Source existing Garage Opener Website that works with Raspberry Pi OS (this version allows you to manually trigger the door to open / close)</li>
									<li>Magnet Contact Sensors – wired to the garage door, wireless sensors to the gate</li>
									<li>Security Camera that can be connected to the network and accessed over NDI</li>
									<li>iOS or Android phone running custom built App</li>
									<li>GPS to get location coordinates of the users</li>
								</ul>

								<h3>Skills Required </h3>

								<p>The end user needs to be able to setup physical hardware and configure the app (step by step instructions to be provided to them). There is no special hardware that would be too hard to find. We would, however, need to find an app developer to create the app and write the software to allow for the automations to occur and hardware to interface seamlessly. We would outsource the app development to a freelancer to work on over 6 months, costing approx. $60,000.</p>

								<h3>Outcome</h3>
								<p>After the app and software is completed, we could speak to a manufacturer and have them build custom kits that we could sell to home owners for them to install in their own home. The project will allow for their garage and gate controls to be autonomous and no longer will they have to worry about if they left the garage door open. They can be assured that the hub has closed it automatically, and if they wanted to double check to confirm that the door is truly closed, they could verify it by viewing the contact sensor state within the app. </p>
